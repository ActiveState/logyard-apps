# A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with
# optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". 

# maximum number of megabytes that are allowed to be read from a file
# (near the end).
